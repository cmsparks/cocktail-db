| prep        = Combine ingredients with ice in cocktail shaker; shake well, then strain into cocktail glass, pouring over ice.
| notes       = 0.5 tsp of simple sugar solution or superfine sugar can added for a sweeter cocktail. The Cloister is normally made using dry gin. The cocktail can be served off the rocks, with no ice in the glass. This recipe, more suited to a larger cocktail glass, calls for:
*1.5 oz gin (6 parts)
*0.5 oz grapefruit juice (2.5 parts)
*0.25 oz lemon juice (1 part)
*0.5 oz yellow chartreuse (1 part)
